# Delivery-Dash
Delivery Dash is a continuation and complete overhaul of my previous Jam entry "10 Seconds or Less". The game will be my first full release title and is looking to be completed by the end of January.

# Gameplay
Delivery Dash is a couch coop delivery game where 2-4 players compete to deliver packages for their respective companies whilst delaying their competitors. Players will collect packages from their companies and deliver them to their respective addresses, all the while delaying their competitors through the destruction of delivery paths, "accidental" collisions, and package theft. 

Drivers need beware, too much chaos and the police will have to step in!
